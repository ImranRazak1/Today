Everday is hard as it is. This simple Reminders app was built using UIKit and some storyboards to help with the segues between views.

## Development notes

#### What went well?

    - Storyboards is great, simple drag and dropping
    - Creating new views was simple as was linking it up to Storyboards


    

#### What could be better?

    - Adding a + button to add new reminders would form as the neccesary funciton of the app.
